# Structure and Organization Analysis

> **Usage**: Analyze how a document is structured and whether the organization serves its purpose.

## Task

Evaluate the structure and organization of the document.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Map the Structure**
   - Identify major sections
   - Note hierarchy (headings, subheadings)
   - Document the flow of information

2. **Evaluate Components**
   - Introduction: Does it set up the content effectively?
   - Body: Is information logically organized?
   - Conclusion: Does it synthesize and close appropriately?
   - Transitions: Are connections between sections clear?

3. **Assess Effectiveness**
   - Does structure serve the document's purpose?
   - Is information easy to find?
   - Does organization enhance or hinder comprehension?

4. **Identify Issues**
   - Structural gaps or redundancies
   - Misplaced content
   - Missing sections
