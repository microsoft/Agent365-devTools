# Argument Analysis

> **Usage**: Evaluate the arguments in a document for structure, strength, and validity.

## Task

Identify and evaluate all arguments presented in the document.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Identify Main Arguments**
   - What claims is the author making?
   - What is the central thesis?
   - How are arguments structured?

2. **Evaluate Each Argument**
   - Premises: Are they stated or implied? Valid?
   - Logic: Does the conclusion follow from the premises?
   - Evidence: What support is provided?
   - Strength: Compelling, adequate, weak, or flawed?

3. **Identify Counterarguments**
   - Does the author address opposing views?
   - Are counterarguments fairly represented?
   - How effectively are they rebutted?

4. **Assess Logical Fallacies**
   - Check for common fallacies (ad hominem, straw man, false dichotomy, etc.)
   - Note any gaps in reasoning

## Output Format
