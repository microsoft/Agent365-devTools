# Critical Analysis

> **Usage**: Perform a critical analysis identifying biases, assumptions, and reasoning gaps.

## Task

Critically evaluate the document for biases, assumptions, and weaknesses.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Identify Biases**
   - Author's perspective or agenda
   - Selection bias in examples/evidence
   - Confirmation bias in conclusions
   - Cultural or institutional bias

2. **Surface Assumptions**
   - What does the author take for granted?
   - Are assumptions stated or hidden?
   - Are they valid?

3. **Find Reasoning Gaps**
   - Logical leaps without support
   - Missing evidence
   - Unexplored alternatives
   - Oversimplifications

4. **Suggest Improvements**
   - How could weaknesses be addressed?
   - What additional evidence is needed?
   - What perspectives are missing?
