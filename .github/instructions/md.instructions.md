Microsoft's brand voice: Above all, simple and human
====================================================

There's what we say, our message. And there's how we say it, our voice.

What do we mean by voice?
-------------------------

The Microsoft voice is how we talk to people. It's the interplay of personality, substance, tone, and style.

Though our voice is constant regardless of who we're talking to or what we're saying, we adapt our tone—from serious to empathetic to lighthearted—to fit the context and the customer's state of mind.

Three voice principles
----------------------

Our voice hinges on crisp simplicity. Bigger ideas and fewer words. Less head, more heart.

Our voice is:

- **Warm and relaxed**—We're natural. Less formal, more grounded in real, everyday conversations. Occasionally, we're fun. (We know when to celebrate.)
- **Crisp and clear**—We're to the point. We write for scanning first, reading second. We make it simple above all.
- **Ready to lend a hand**—We show customers we're on their side. We anticipate their real needs and offer great information at just the right time.

A focus on the customer
-----------------------

Talking to our customers in a way that's warm and relaxed, crisp and clear, and ready to lend a hand reflects our commitment to empowering people to achieve more.

### Style tips

A few key elements of writing Microsoft's voice:

- Get to the point fast. Start with the key takeaway. Put the most important thing in the most noticeable spot. Make choices and next steps obvious. Give people just enough information to make decisions confidently. Don't get in the way.
- Talk like a person. Choose optimistic, conversational language. Use short everyday words, contractions, and sentence-style capitalization. Shun jargon and acronyms. And never miss an opportunity to find a better word.
- Simpler is better. Everyone likes clarity and getting to the point. Break it up. Step it out. Layer. Short sentences and fragments are easier to scan and read. Prune every excess word.

Top tips for Microsoft style and voice
======================================

Use bigger ideas, fewer words
-----------------------------

Our modern design hinges on crisp minimalism. Shorter is always better.

### Example

Replace this:
> If you're ready to purchase Office 365 for your organization, contact your Microsoft account representative.

With this:
> Ready to buy? Contact us.

Write like you speak
--------------------

Write like you speak. Read your text aloud. Avoid jargon and overly complex or technical language. It should sound like a friendly conversation.


Get to the point fast
---------------------

Lead with what's most important. Front-load keywords for scanning. Make customer choices and next steps obvious.

### Example

Replace this:
> Templates provide a starting point for creating new documents. A template can include the styles, formats, and page layouts you use frequently. Consider creating a template if you often use the same page layout and style for documents.

With this:
> Save time by creating a document template that includes the styles, formats, and page layouts you use most often. Then use the template whenever you create a new document.

Be brief
--------

Give customers just enough information to make decisions confidently. Prune every excess word.

### Example

Replace this:
> The Recommended Charts command on the Insert tab recommends charts that are likely to represent your data well. Use the command when you want to visually present data, and you're not sure how to do it.

With this:
> Create a chart that's just right for your data by using the Recommended Charts command on the Insert tab.

When in doubt, don't capitalize
-------------------------------

Default to sentence-style capitalization—capitalize only the first word of a heading or phrase and any proper nouns or names. Never Use Title Capitalization (Like This). Never Ever.

### Examples

Replace these:
> Find a Microsoft Partner
> Office 365 Customer
> Limited-Time Offer
> Join Us Online

With these:
> Find a Microsoft partner
> Office 365 customer
> Limited-time offer
> Join us online

Remember the last comma
-----------------------

In a list of three or more items, include a comma before the conjunction. (The comma that comes before the conjunction is known as the Oxford or serial comma.)

### Example

Replace this:
> Android, iOS and Windows

With this:
> Android, iOS, and Windows

Don't be spacey
---------------

Use only one space after periods, question marks, and colons—and no spaces around dashes.

### Example

Replace this:
> Use pipelines — logical groups of activities — to consolidate activities that are part of a task.

With this:
> Use pipelines—logical groups of activities—to consolidate activities that are part of a task.

Revise weak writing
-------------------

Most of the time, start each statement with a verb. Edit out you can and there is, there are, there were.

### Example

Replace this:
> You can access Office apps across your devices, and you get online file storage and sharing.

With this:
> Store files online, access them from all your devices, and share them with coworkers.

Word choice
===========

To improve readability and comprehension, choose your words wisely and use them consistently. If you mean the same thing, use the same word.

Use contractions
----------------

Write using the same, everyday words you use in conversation.

- Use common contractions, such as it's, you're, that's, and don't, to create a friendly, informal tone.
- Don't mix contractions and their spelled-out equivalents in UI text. For example, don't use can't and cannot in the same UI.
- Never form a contraction from a noun and a verb, such as Microsoft's developing a lot of new cloud services.
- Avoid ambiguous or awkward contractions, such as there'd, it'll, and they'd.


Use simple words, concise sentences
-----------------------------------

Make every word count. Concise, clear sentences save space, are easy to understand, and facilitate scanning. Use simple words with precise meanings, and remove words that don't add substance. Use your judgment to avoid sounding abrupt or unfriendly.

- Choose simple verbs without modifiers. Whenever you can, avoid weak or vague verbs, such as be, have, make, and do.
  
  Examples

  | Use this | Not this                      |
  | -------- | ----------------------------- |
  | use	     | utilize, make use of          |
  | remove	 | extract, take away, eliminate |
  | tell	 | inform, let know              |

- Don't use two or three words when one will do.

  Examples

  | Use this | Not this                   |
  | -------- | -------------------------- |
  | to	     | in order to, as a means to |
  | also	 | in addition                |
  | connect	 | establish connectivity     |

- Whenever possible, choose words that have one clear meaning.

  Example

  Replace this:
  > *Because* you created the table, you can change it.
  
  With this:
  > *Since* you created the table, you can change it.

- Omit unnecessary adverbs—words that describe how, when, or where. Unless they're important to the meaning of a statement, leave them out. Examples would be quickly, easily, effectively, and so on.

- Use one term consistently to represent one concept.

- Use words that can be both nouns and verbs carefully—file, post, mark, screen, record, and report, for example. Use the sentence structure and context to eliminate ambiguity.

Don't use common words in new ways
----------------------------------

Most people know the common definition of words—usually the one that appears first in the dictionary. Use words in the most familiar sense, or define them if you can't.

- Don't create a new word from an existing word. For example, don't use bucketize to mean group.

- Don't apply a new meaning to an ordinary word. For example, don't use graveyard to mean archive.

- Be careful with common words that have industry-specific uses. Assume customers know the common definition of the word, not the industry-specific definition. If you must use the industry-specific definition, define the word in context.
Writing tip Sometimes industry-specific usage, such as hacker, becomes part of everyday speech. Know your customer and the language they use. When in doubt, use a simple word with a well-understood meaning.

- Don't use verbs as nouns or nouns as verbs.

  Examples

  | Use this               | Not this           |
  | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
  | affect performance     | impact performance |
  | download the paper     | get the download   |
  | respond to the request | respond to the ask |

Use technical terms carefully
-----------------------------

Technical terms come in a variety of shapes and sizes. Sometimes they're everyday words that are given new meanings, like cloud, batch, or dashboard. Other times, common words are combined to create technical terms, like telemedicine or email. Over time, some technical terms become widely understood, but before that happens, they can be confusing to people who aren't familiar with them. Use technical terms when they're the clearest way to communicate your message, but use them with care.

- Use common words whenever possible. Don't use a technical term when an everyday term will do. For example, don't use rip to refer to copying files from a CD if you can use copy instead.
- Don't assume everyone will understand technical terms. When you must use technical terms for precise communication, define them in context.
- Use technical terms consistently. When you've decided to use a technical term, use that term consistently across products and services, tools, websites, and marketing communications. Aim for one term, one concept.
- Use industry-specific terms for professional audiences. Many industries and professions have their own terminology: banking, healthcare, construction, IT, and project management, for example.
- Don't create a new term if an existing one serves your purpose. If you must create a new term, verify that it isn't already being used to mean something else.

Avoid jargon
------------

In the right context, for a particular audience, jargon serves as shorthand for well-understood concepts. But for less technical audiences, jargon can impede understanding.

Don't use jargon if:

- You can use a more familiar term, such as symbol instead of glyph.
- The term is familiar to only a small segment of your readers.
- The term isn't specific to software, networking, cloud services, and so on.

Avoid business, marketing, and journalistic jargon, such as using leverage to mean take advantage of.
